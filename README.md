A Discord bot that automatically creates a room on w2g.tv for a given url.

## __**ðŸ“º Usage:**__

1. Send a message containing at least one link/url.
2. React to that message using the ðŸ“º emote.

The bot will then answer with a link to your private w2g.tv room.

## Host yourself:

Just clone this repository and compile it.  
Start the bot once and a `config.json` file will be created. Fill that file with your API keys/tokens (Discord and W2G.TV).  
Start the bot again.
